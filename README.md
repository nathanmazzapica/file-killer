# File Killer
A fun experiment that allows the player to wreak havoc on their own filesystem as the protagonist in a top-down shooter.

## WARNING
Files in the directory you target will be _**PERMANENTLY**_ deleted. Please use common sense when using this if you decide to.

## Why?
I wanted to see if I could


## End Goal
I would eventually like to boot this game up on a linux VM and see what parts of the OS I can destroy before everything falls apart
