# File Killer
A fun experiment that allows the player to wreak havoc on their own filesystem as the protagonist in a top-down shooter.


## Why?
I wanted to see if I could


## End Goal
I would eventually like to boot this game up on a linux VM and see what parts of the OS I can destroy before everything falls apart
